# Discord-token-grabber
Discord token grabber is a system that allows you to steal tokens or personal information from anyone you want.
This script is designed to collect Discord tokens and user information by scanning local storage files from various browser applications and extensions such as Discord, Chrome, Opera, and others. It retrieves sensitive information like tokens, Nitro subscription details, servers (guilds), and other account details, then sends it to a Discord webhook in a formatted message.
